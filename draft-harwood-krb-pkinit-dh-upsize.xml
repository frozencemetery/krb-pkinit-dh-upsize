        <abstract>
            <t>Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos
            (PKINIT) permits a client and a Kerberos Domain Controller (KDC)
            to use a Diffie-Hellman (DH) exchange to derive an encryption key.
            The group with minimum modulus size permitted for this exchange is
            1024 bits, which recent security research has shown to provide
            insufficient protection against organizations with sufficient
            computing resources, such as state-sponsored actors.  This
            document updates RFC 4556 to increase the minimum group size to
            2048 bits and define permitted groups of size larger than
            4096-bits.</t>

        <section title="Introduction">
            <t><xref target="RFC4556" /> specified three permitted groups for
            DH, which have modulus sizes 1024, 2048, and 4096 bits,
            respectively.  It requires implementation of the 1024-bit and
            2048-bit groups, while the 4096-bit group is optional albeit
            recommended.  This document updates <xref target="RFC4556" />
            such that the 1024-bit group is no longer permitted and
            implementation of the 4096-bit group is required based on more
            recent understanding of DH group weaknesses <xref target="LOGJAM"
            />.  It also defines two larger groups for futureproofing.</t>

            <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
            NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
            in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
            target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Modulus Size Increases">
            <t>In 2015, <xref target="LOGJAM" /> showed by example that it is
            very possible to break 768-bit DH groups.  The authors extend
            their method to 1024-bit DH groups as well, and their analysis
            shows breaking 1024-bit DH groups to be within the reach of
            state-sponsored actors (or others with that level of computing
            resources).  Accordingly, this document prohibits the use of the
            previously permitted 1024-bit group and recommends the use of the
            4096-bit group.</t>
            
            <t><xref target="RFC4556" /> specifies three groups that can be
            used for Diffie-Hellman (DH) <xref target="RFC2631" /> key
            exchange between the client and Kerberos Domain Controller (KDC)
            <xref target="RFC4120" />: Oakley 1024-bit Modular Exponential
            (MODP) well-known group 2 from <xref target="RFC2412" />, Oakley
            2048-bit MODP well-known group 14 from <xref target="RFC3526" />,
            and Oakley 4096-bit MODP well-known group 16 from <xref
            target="RFC3526" />.  Of the three, implementations were required
            to support the 1024-bit and 2048-bit groups, while the 4096-bit
            group was optional.</t>

            <t>Specifically, this document updates <xref target="RFC4556" />
            Section 3.2.1, Item 8, Paragraph 1 as follows:</t>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    implementations MUST NOT support Oakley 1024-bit MODP
                    well-known group 2 <xref target="RFC2412" /> or any other
                    group with modulus size strictly less than 2048 bits
                </li>

                <li>
                    implementations MAY support Oakley 2048-bit MODP
                    well-known group 14 <xref target="RFC3526" />
                </li>

                <li>
                    implementations MUST support Oakley 4096-bit MODP
                    well-known group 16 <xref target="RFC3526" />
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section title="Additional Groups">
            <t>For futureproofing, we define two additional DH groups with
            larger modulus size.  Implementations MAY support 6114-bit MODP
            group 17 and/or 8192-bit MODP group 18, both as defined by <xref
            target="RFC3526" />.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Interoperability">
            <t><xref target="RFC4556" /> mandated the implementation of two
            groups (of modulus size 1024-bit and 2048-bit respectively).
            While this document prohibits use of the 1024-bit group, use of
            the 2048-bit group is still permitted.  Thus, pre-existing
            implementations could use either that 2048-bit group or the
            optional 4096-bit group for communication with an implementation
            that conforms to this document.</t>

            <t><xref target="RFC4556" /> permits KDC policy to reject DH
            groups with error code KDC_ERR_DH_KEY_PARAMETERS_NOT_ACCEPTED.
            Conforming implementations are thus already prepared to handle
            group selection failure.  Two major implementations of Kerberos,
            MIT krb5 and Heimdal, have a configuration option for group
            selection (pkinit_dh_min_bits).  In particular, the default value
            has always been 2048 for MIT krb5, which added PKINIT support in
            2007.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Security Considerations">
            <t>The security considerations of <xref target="RFC4556" />
            continue to apply.  As that document states:</t>

            <blockquote>
                Kerberos error messages are not integrity protected; as a
                result, the domain parameters sent by the KDC as
                TD-DH-PARAMETERS can be tampered with by an attacker so that
                the set of domain parameters selected could be either weaker
                or not mutually preferred.  Local policy can configure sets of
                domain parameters acceptable locally, or disallow the
                negotiation of DH domain parameters.
            </blockquote>

            <t>By removing known-dangerous groups, this document attempts to
            mitigate this attack.  This document also permits implementation
            of only the 4096-bit group, which would effectively disallow
            parameter negotiation.  However, as the field remains unprotected,
            it is still subject to Denial of Service from tampering in
            transit.</t>
